### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every Jenga API is different and our goal is to create a package that is flexible enough to help most integrations. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Develoment is needed
- **qa-needed**: This requires testing
- **documentation-needed**: This requires documentation
- **bug-high-priority**: This task is "top priority"
- **bug-low-priority**: This task is "low priority"
- **help-wanted**: Extra attention is needed

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
